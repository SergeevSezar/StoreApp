    <string name="drill_interskol_info">INTERSKOL was founded in 1991, and in 2003 it became the one selling the largest number of power tools in Russia. It has never lost the 1st place ever since.Main production site: INTERSKOL - Alabuga (the Republic of Tatarstan, Alabuga Special Economic Zone) - the biggest production plant of power tools in the Eastern Europe; it boasts automated manufacturing process and the largest possible amount of local parts and materials used for production. The facility can deliver as much as 40% of import substitution production in the most in-demand categories of power tools (batteries, electrical drills and perforators, angle grinders, etc.) Currently, the production capacity of the plant is up to 2,000,000 units per year.At the same time, INTERSKOL has one of the most advanced engineering bureaus in Russia. Its portfolio includes over 500 patents.INTERSKOLs products can found in more than 10,000 shops in Russia and abroad. Also, it is the only Russian company in this field that has been recognized outside Russia as since 2009 it has been a member of the European Power Tool Association</string>
    <string name="drill_makita_info">In March 1915, Mosaburo Makita (b. 1893) founded Makita Electric Works in Nagoya, Aichi, Japan and began selling and repairing lighting equipment, motors and transformers. In 1958, Makita marketed a portable electrical planer in Japan and became a manufacturer of power tools the following year. In April 1969, they introduced the 6500D battery-powered drill (the first rechargeable power tool). In December 1978, they launched the 6010D rechargeable drill (the first nickel cadmium battery tool). In August 1997, the 6213D rechargeable driver-drill was exhibited at the Chicago Hardware Show (the first nickel hydride battery tool). In February 2005, the TD130D (the first lithium-ion battery tool) was made available.Makita ships many of its power tools in Systainer-compatible stacking boxes. In 2011 Makita registered a design for its own "Makpac" variant in the names of Yuji Yamamoto and Kiyozumi Kokawa</string>
    <string name="drill_dewalt_info">The original company was started in 1923 by Raymond E. DeWalt, the inventor of the radial arm saw. The company grew quickly and was reorganized and re incorporated in 1947 as DeWalt Inc. After buying the company in 1949, American Machine and Foundry Co., Inc. sold it to Black and Decker in 1960. Black and Decker divested itself of the radial arm saw manufacturing branch in 1989, selling it to two executives. Radial arm saws that use the original DeWalt design can still be obtained from the Original Saw Co.In 1992, Black and Decker started a major effort to rebrand its professional quality and high-end power tools to DeWalt. In 1994, DeWalt took over the German wood working power tool producer ELU. DeWalt increased their line of tools using ELUs technology. As of 2001, DeWalt manufactures and sells more than 200 different power hand tools and 800 accessories.DeWalt is now a popular brand of tools for commercial contractors. In 2004, Black and Decker bought rival power tool manufacturer Porter-Cable and combined it with DeWalt in Jackson, Tennessee. In 2011, DeWalt launched a line of contractors hand tools (including utility knives, pliers, adjustable wrenches, tape measures, saws, and hammers). In 2013, the line was expanded to include mechanics tools (wrenches, ratchets, and sockets).In December 2013, DeWalt issued a press release stating it would be bringing some assembly of a small selection of their products to the United States using globally manufactured parts from Brazil, China, the Czech Republic, Italy, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The products assembled in the United States would be branded under the label, Built in the USA with global materials.As of 2015, DeWalt has seven manufacturing facilities building DeWalt branded products in the United States: New Britain, CT, Hampstead, MD, Shelbyville, KY, Greenfield, IN, Cheraw, SC, Charlotte, NC, and Jackson, TN.In April 2016, DeWalt created an Android powered smartphone designed for building industry workers. The device, which costs £379 ($544), is designed to survive a 2 m (6 ft 7 in) drop onto concrete and has an operating range of −20–60 °C (−4–140 °F).[10]On September 1, 2016, DeWalt debuted its FlexVolt hybrid voltage battery pack, an industry first. The pack can switch between series battery wiring providing 60 V (54 V nominal) and 2 Ah, or parallel wiring for 20 V (18 V nominal) and 6 Ah, depending upon whether it is installed in a 60 V or 20 V tool as determined by communications between the tool and the battery.In May 2018, DeWalt released a line of 20 V and 40 V cordless lawn mowers</string>
